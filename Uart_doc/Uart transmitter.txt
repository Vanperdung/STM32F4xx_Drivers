Step to do Data Transmission:
	1. Program the M bit in USART_CR1 to define the word length.
	2. Program the number of stop bits in the USART_CR2 register.
	3. Select the desired baudrate using USART_BRR register.
	4. Set the TE bit in USART_CR1 to enable the transmit block.
	5. Enable the USART by writing the USART ENABLE bit in USART_CR1.
	6. Now if TXE flag is set, then write the data byte to send, in the USART_DR register.
	7. After writing the last data into the USART_DR register, wait until TC=1. (This indicates
 that the transmission of the last frame is complete)
	Remember if software wants to disable USART or UART peripheral, then it has to do it after
TC bit is set(TC stands for Transmission Complete flag).
